If YES (high train error), we make bigger network, train more layers, etc, then retrain the model.

However, looking only at the accuracy score is not enough.\n\n\n\nMODEL 1\nPredict 0\nPredict 1\n\n\n\n\nActuals 0\n238,541\n847\n\n\nActuals 1\n2,648\n40\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMODEL 2\nPredict 0\nPredict 1\n\n\n\n\nActuals 0\n180,896\n58,492\n\n\nActuals 1\n550\n2,138\n\n\n\nLet’s say we want to detect frauds. The model output equals 1 means it predicts the transaction is a fraud. In our dataset, we have majority transactions are not frauds which are 0. When we train a model, we easily get high accuracy score because we have imbalanced dataset which has more 0 than 1. Comparing the accuracy score between two models, Model 1 has accuracy score : (238541+ 40)/(238541+ 847+ 2648+40) = 0.98556, and Model 2 has accuracy score: (180896+ 2138)/(180896+ 58492 + 550 +2138) = 0.7561. If we choose a model based on the accuracy score, we will choose Model 1 because it has high accuracy score. It’s able to predict 98.556% correctly.\nHowever, we can see that Model 1 is able to predict 40 out 2688 frauds. The recall score is 40/(40+2648)= 0.01488= 1.488% which means the model doesn’t capture frauds, only 1.488% of frauds are predicted. On the other hand, the Model 2 recall score = 2138 / (550 + 2138) = 0.79539 = 79.539%. It means we are able to capture 79.539% of frauds. In the Model 2, we think a lot of normal transactions are frauds, but it’s worth to check them to make sure they are not frauds."

    "text": "I filter stocks based on Return on Investment (ROI) which can tell use how effective a company use its money, and Net Profit which tell us if the company is making money or not. We want to invest into companies that are making money, right? All the companies listed here have over 40% Institutional ownership in them. It means Institutional Investors believe and invest into the companies for long-term growth. You also try to minimize Debt/Equity which tell you how much debt compares to equity. The bigger number means the company has more debt which is not good. However, a company sometimes has to borrow money to invest in its future.\nMoreover, you can look at dividend yield if you want to reduce the number of stocks you invest.
