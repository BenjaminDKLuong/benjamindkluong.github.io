    "Let's say we want to detect frauds.  The model output equals 1 means it predicts the transaction is a fraud.  In our dataset, we have majority transactions are not frauds which are 0.  When we train a model, we easily get high accuracy score because we have imbalanced dataset which has more 0 than 1.  Comparing the accuracy score between two models, Model 1 has accuracy score : (238541+ 40)/(238541+ 847+ 2648+40) = 0.98556, and Model 2 has accuracy score: (180896+ 2138)/(180896+ 58492 + 550 +2138) = 0.7561.  If we choose a model based on the accuracy score, we will choose Model 1 because it has high accuracy score.  It's able to predict 98.556% correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can see that Model 1 is able to predict 40 out 2688 frauds.  The recall score is 40/(40+2648)= 0.01488= 1.488% which means the model doesn't capture frauds, only 1.488% of frauds are predicted.  On the other hand, the Model 2 recall score = 2138 / (550 + 2138) = 0.79539 = 79.539%.  It means we are able to capture 79.539% of frauds.  In the Model 2, we think a lot of normal transactions are frauds, but it's worth to check them to make sure they are not frauds."
